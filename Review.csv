0,Tim Roberts,"Ok for the price!  UPDATE
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  Bought on for my wife and one for myself. Mine would not fit around my wrist.  Not too sure how accurate some of the readings are, but for the price my wife likes that it gives message and call alerts among other things.I am changing my review to 5 stars.  I was contacted by the seller, I think the same day I wrote this review.  They were very apologetic and informed me they were sending another fitness tracker with a longer band.  I received it a day earlier than they said it would be here.  I am very happy with the way they handled the situation, and was not expecting it.  My wife likes hers more every day and says the accuracy seems to be closer the more she wears it.  Can‚Äôt wait to see how this one works for me!!  I appreciate their quick response and would buy from them again!!"
1,Lisa M. McLeod,"Great little fitness tracker.
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I only wanted something to track my steps. This does basically everything a fitbit can do, just doesn't cost you $$$ like fitbit. Step count seems to be very accurate, Heartbeat tracker seems to work well, the sleep monitor works good. The battery life is really good, I can go days without recharging it. The app you download onto your smart phone is easy to navigate. Takes a tiny bit of playing around with to figure out everything it can do, but it's still rather simple to get around in. What can I say it does what it says it does."
2,Bauervision,"Great fitness tracker starting point
",4.0 out of 5 stars,"  It's one of the cheapest trackers out there and is a good entry point to determine if this is an area you'd like to invest in.I'm not sure how accurate, honestly any of the measurements are, but its not like I personally need to know. It gives me a somewhat reasonable picture of metrics and for now I'm ok with believing what it says.  I think the step counter is the least reliable as I am a programmer and at the end of the day it says I took 7k steps, close to someone who had an active walking job--which gives me doubt in its reliability.I like the sedentary reminder, sleep analysis, and HR monitor. The number of workouts is nice too, specifically Hiit training. My biggest complaint is probably the battery life. Every 2 days to charge might not seem bad, but it's getting to where it seems like its daily.Overall it's a good value for the money. Get it, see if it brings you some valuable insight into your daily physical activity and if this is something you can enjoy, and then upgrade later."
3,Bret Choitz,"You get what you pay for... And dead in 2.5 Months
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The price is good.  I wanted a heart rate monitor I could wear for daily activities and for sleep monitoring.You MUST use the cell phone app to get the time sync'd and set up various functions on the watch.There are a limited number of display options available, and NONE that show Heart rate with a big enough font to actually see the number easily.  I would be happy with a split screen option for HR and Time, but that isn't an optionIf you want to see the step counter, there are many more options for that.The cell interface gives two options when you download.. A ""Lite"" version that doesn't require ""signing Up"" and providing an email address, and a full version that does require signing up but promises more features.  Don't expect more features, other than supposedly having your data stored in the cloud for you to retrieve if something goes wrong with the cell phone.The BT connection seems to fail more that it works.  Right now I want to turn OFF a function that illuminates the watch from movement, but can't seem to get the app to connect to the phone.Update:. After 2.5 months the display no longer works, so this is now trash.Things I really didn't like:Charging by removing 1/2 the band and plugging directly into USB.  That was much less convenient than a micro USB, and not all USB jacks would allow it to fully insert.Required app on phone that wanted to always run in background.Not a decent face style for easily looking at heart rate.  Steps yes, HR no.üôÅSo, two stars because you get what you pay for.  A cheap waterproof watch that sometimes provides additional information.I'll probably send it back, but will give it a few more days first."
4,April Eubanks (Pick Me!),"Save your time and frustration on this one
",2.0 out of 5 stars,"  The tracker itself is never correct. My steps were outside an acceptable margin of error and it only caught about half of my sleep hours. The worst part though is the app you use with it. It was constantly a struggle to pair it and keep it paired. Even still, I had to uninstsll the app and reinstall it every time I had to pair it for it to work. It never synced the data from the tracker to the app though, even connected. A different app and I may have kept it and tried to learn the error and accommodate for it. It was lightweight and easy to charge if you're looking for pros."
5,Grandma BJ,"Not real happy
",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  I received my fitness tracker on August 4th and started the set up immediately.  While I do not like to leave bad reviews I have to list the problems I have encountered.  The app was easy to install but it did not want to link up with the tracker, after several tries I finally got them to sync.  I find that the only feature that works is the time, the step count is off, the temp is never close to being normal range and the BP should have me in the hospital with its ranges.  I am sure it is a bad unit as others seem to have no problem.  I do really like the sleekness of the tracker and the band is wonderful and fits perfect.  Unfortunately it will have to be returned."
6,CJ,"Intuitive, light weight and does what it says out of the box
",5.0 out of 5 stars,"  I bought 3 of these watches as gifts, they all arrived on time, battery came charged to 50%, I didn't have to read the instructions to figure out how they work (I opened all three to test them before giving away). These watches only have 1 capacitive button but it is fairly intuitive to use, the screen is NOT touch just so you know. Wrist bands are soft, not premium but great quality for the price. To charge them you have to remove the top band to reveal a USB male connector that plugs into a computer or charger.As cheap gifts they are awesome, if I didn't already have a watch I would consider one for myself."
7,Tammy French,"Great item for the price
",5.0 out of 5 stars,  I was looking for an inexpensive fitness tracker that had what I wanted on it and I found it with this one. Super easy to set up and use. Works great with my phone. Really enjoying using this tracker!! Just wish it had longer/wider straps! Would highly recommend this one for your beginning fitness needs.
